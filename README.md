## Introduction

Welcome to my submission for the Frontend Mentor Ping Coming Soon Page challenge. This project is part of Frontend Mentor's initiative to enhance coding skills through realistic projects.

## Challenge Overview

The challenge involves building a Coming Soon page with specific design requirements. Users should be able to view an optimal layout based on their device's screen size, experience hover states for interactive elements, submit their email address using an `input` field, and receive appropriate error messages for form submissions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project Structure

- The project is structured according to the designs provided in the `/design` folder.
- Both mobile and desktop versions are implemented for responsiveness.
- JPG static formats are used for design elements, requiring judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`.
- Assets are stored in the `/images` folder, already optimized.
